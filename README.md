# spacex-launch-analysis
Analyzing SpaceX launch data using Python and SQL

---

## 🧪 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze SpaceX Falcon 9 launch records and uncover patterns that influence launch success. The project covered:

- Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL
- Interactive visualizations with Folium & Plotly
- Launch site proximity analysis
- Launch success prediction using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN)
- A comprehensive PDF presentation of the findings
